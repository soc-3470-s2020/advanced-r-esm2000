## 2.2.2 Exercises 

1. Explain the relationship between `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` in the following code:

```{r}
a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10

obj_addr(a)
obj_addr(b)
obj_addr(c)
obj_addr(d)
```

There are two objects that are both vectors containing numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). `a`, `b`, and `c` refer to the first object and `d` refer to the second object.
