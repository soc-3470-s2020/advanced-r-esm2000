# Data Types Exercises

1. Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

```
mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 4, ]
mtcars[-1:4, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]
```

```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, ]
mtcars[2:4, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5, ]
mtcars[(mtcars$cyl == 4 | mtcars$cyl == 6), ]
```

2. Why does `x <- 1:5; x[NA]` yield five missing values? (Hint: why is it different from `x[NA_real_]`?)

```{r}
x <- 1:5
x[NA]
x[NA_real_]
```

`x <- 1:5; x[NA]` yields five missing values because since `NA` is a logical vector it gets recycled four times.
